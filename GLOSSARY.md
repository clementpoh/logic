# Axiom
A premise, presupposition or starting point for logical reasoning. They were
classically conceived to be self-evident. Axioms are supposed to be accepted as
true without controversy. Truth definitely known.

Logical systems begin  with *axioms*. Axioms are the premises and premises for
reasoning in a logical system. In current philosophy, there are many opinions
on what it means for a logical or mathematical statement to be true. However,
the ancients believed axioms to be self-evident; true without needing
explanation. Axioms are truth definitely known.

# Valid argument
An argument that follows from its premises or base assumptions. When the
premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

# Tautology
Also valid, a tautology is a logical formula that is always true. For example
the formula $$\neg P \lor P$$ is a tautology.

# Unsatisfiable
A logical formula is unsatisfiable if it can never be true. For example the
formula $$\neg P \land P$$ is unsatisfiable.

# Law of non-contradiction
Contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same
time. $$\neg P \land P$$ is unsatisfiable.

# Law of the excluded middle
For any proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is true.
$$\neg P \lor P$$ is a tautology.

# Sound argument
Distinct from the soundness of logical systems. A sound argument is valid
argument whose premises are philosophically true.
