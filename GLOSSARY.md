# Valid argument
An argument that follows from its premises or base assumptions. When the
premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

# Tautology
Also valid, a tautology is a logical formula that is always true. For example
$$\neg P \lor P$$ is a tautology.

# Unsatisfiable
A logical formula is unsatisfiable if it can never be true. For example $$\neg P
\land P$$ is unsatisfiable.

# Sound argument
Distinct from sound logical systems. A sound argument is valid argument whose
premises are philosophically true.
