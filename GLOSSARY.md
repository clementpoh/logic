# Valid argument
An argument that follows from its premises or base assumptions. When the
premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

# Tautology
Also valid, a tautology is a logical formula that is always true. For example the formula $$\neg P \lor P$$ is a tautology.

# Unsatisfiable
A logical formula is unsatisfiable if it can never be true. For example the formula $$\neg P \land P$$ is unsatisfiable.

# Law of non-contradiction
Contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time. $$\neg P \land P$$ is unsatisfiable.

# Law of the undistributed middle
For any proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is true. $$\neg P \lor P$$ is a tautology.

# Sound argument
Distinct from the soundness of logical systems. A sound argument is valid argument whose premises are philosophically true.
