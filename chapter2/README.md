# Ebullient Logic

## Previous section summary

As a summary, in the previous section:
* We had a quick look at the history of logic from ancient times to the
  beginning of modern logic today.
* We established the necessity of the concept of truth in logic and some of its
  properties.
* We demonstrated the limit of logic showing how logically valid arguments can
  be philosophically flawed.
* We explored the importance of consistency while examining some self-refuting
  claims.
* We discussed the affect of human psychology on the ability to reason
  effectively.
* Finally, we managed to progress to Plato. We discussed a few argumentative
  fallacies that people are prone to making.

## What's next

Boolean algebra was revolutionary because it allows us to rigorously and
mechanically reason about statements logically. Once a set of statements are
translated into a logical formula they can be manipulated to find equivalent
statements, logical consequences, and determine the argument's validity.

In this section the following shall be discussed.
* Separate from the underlying philosophical assumptions, validity of logical     arguments can by recognised by their form.
* We will cover the most basic formalisation of symbolic logic,
  Boolean Algebra, its conventions and how they differ from language.
* We will translate arguments in English into logic; interpret logical       formulas back into English.
* We shall see how it's possible to mathematically establish some logical    consequences of an argument, and its validity.
* We will also study how Boolean logic is applied to computers.
