## Formulating first steps

In logic an argument is a sequence of statements demonstrating the truth of an
assertion. The form of the argument is separate from the content of the
argument. The truth of an argument necessarily follows from its form.

1. If $$x^2 = 25$$ then either $$x = 5$$ or $$x = -5$$.
1. x cannot be negative.
1. Therefore, $$x = 5$$.

This may be a trivial set of statements, but consider the next one too.

1. When an article is submitted, it is either published or sent back for further editing.
1. A submitted article was not sent back for further editing.
1. Therefore, the article was published.

These arguments are about different topics, but they are of the same form. Both
are *disjunctive syllogisms*. Arguments of the form:

1. *P* or *Q*.
1. Not *Q*.
1. Therefore *P*.

Previously we saw an example of the Modus Ponens argument. Modus ponens
arguments have the form:

1. If *P* then *Q*.
1. *P*
1. Therefore *Q*.

## Producing propositions

Arguments are composed of propositions. Propositions may be true or false but
not both. "$$1 + 1 = 2$$" is a true proposition. While, contrary to English
teachers and management gurus "$$1 + 1 = 3$$" is a false proposition. Some
propositions depend on terms references within the proposition: "The car is
red". The truth of the sentence depends on which car is being referred to.
