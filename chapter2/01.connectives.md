## First stepts to formulas

In logic an argument is a sequence of statements demonstrating the truth of an
assertion. The form of the argument is separate from the content of the
argument. The truth of an argument necessarily follows from its form.

1. If $$x^2 = 25$$ then either $$x = 5$$ or $$x = -5$$.
1. x cannot be negative.
1. Therefore, $$x = 5$$. 

1. When an article is submitted, it is either published or sent back for further editing.
1. A submitted article was not sent back for further editing.
1. Therefore, the article was published.

These may be trivial, but they are of the same form. Both are *disjunctive
syllogisms*. Arguments of the form:

1. *P* or *Q*.
1. Not *Q*.
1. Therefore *P*.

Previously we saw an example of the Modus Ponens argument. Modus ponens
arguments have the form:

1. If *P* then *Q*.
1. *P*
1. Therefore *Q*.
