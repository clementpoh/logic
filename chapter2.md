# The limits of logic

Before getting started it helps to highlight what logic is, why it was
developed, and how to apply it correctly.

Logic is not the art of persuasion. Socrates and Plato recognised the
relationship between truth and persuasion. The ancient Sophists could seemingly
win any argument through their words, at the expense of the truth. They could
turn truth into lies; and lies into truth.

Truth and the pursuit of it might be unfashionable concepts nowadays; however,
Logic was developed as a set of rules in search of the truth. It is a tool to
differentiate truth from lies. At the very least, we can use it to be less
wrong.

## The existence of truth

If the existence of truth is not accepted, meaning collapses and everything
collapses into incoherence. Consider the following statement:

> Nothing is true.

Think about it for a second. Is the statement true? There are only two options,
either the statement is true or it's false. If the statement is false, then the
truth exists. If however, the statement is true then the statement itself is
true, and therefore false. It's self refuting!

Conversely, consider the proposition:

> Everything is true.

Now think about that for a second. If the statement is false, then not
everything is true. However, if everything is true then the opposite, nothing,
is true too. This assertion is also contradictory. So we can conclude that not
everything is true.

## The philosophical properties of truth

For the purposes of the discussion the following are taken to be properties of
truth.

* *Truth is exclusive* - Once the truth of a claim is established, mutually
  exclusive claims are known to be false. If we accept $$1 + 1 = 2$$. We know
  that $$1 + 1 \neq 3$$.
* *Truth is consistent* - A proposition found to be true will not contradict
  other claims known to be true.

On a philosophical level there are more properties of truth, 

* *Truth is coherent* - The truth matches reality.
