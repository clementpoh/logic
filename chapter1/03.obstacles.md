# Obstacles to objectivity

History is littered with the bodies of bad arguments based on faulty reasoning.
Humans and human institutions are renowned for their resistance to
rectification. 

He possibly had personality problems, but through his telescope Galileo showed
the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar system to be true as the
establishment of his day falsely clung to their geocentric epicycles.

Between 1877 to 1887 Michelson and Morley repeatedly attempted to measure the
speed of light travelling in perpendicular directions to measure the absolute
frame of reference, the aether. Due to the rotation of the earth, they expected
to measure different speeds. They believed their experiments failed as the speed
of light was measured to be constant. 

Refusing to taking the results lightly led Einstein to Special Relativity. The
absolutes of time and space assumed by Newton and the prevailing aether
assumption of the early 20th century were replaced by the absolute of the speed
of light.

History has amply demonstrated human intransigence. Often people favour and
recall information that only reinforces their own beliefs. When faced with
information that contradicts their beliefs they would rather distort reality
than to face up to it. Psychology has graciously bequeathed us with the terms
for these phenomena confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.


Later in life, unsettled by the implications of quantam mechanics, Einstein
apparently famously declared

> God does not play dice.

When following premises to their logical conclusions lead to questionable
conclusions, it is worth reexamining the premises.

To correctly refute an argument, the falsehood of either the assumptions or the
process deriving the conclusion must be shown to be incorrect.

A person can pay lip-service to truth, logic and reason but may be quite
content to live with their contradictions.
