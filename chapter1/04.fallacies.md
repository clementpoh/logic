# Adducing addled arguments

History has decisively demonstrated human obstinacy. Often people favour and
recall information that only reinforce their own beliefs. When faced with data
that contradicts their beliefs many would rather distort reality than to face
up to it. Freud dubbed it *rationalizing*, Camus called them *ulterior motives*.
Psychology has graciously bequeathed us with terms for these phenomena:
confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance. However, it could be naivety or
none of the above. Motives are irrelevant to the truth of claims.

The following are common pitfalls people potentially posit when wielding faulty
reasoning.

* Dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating its absurdity.

* Arguments from ignorance.
  * I don't know statistics, but I know they can lie.
  * I can't believe it, so it must be false!

* Arguments from silence - Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

* Argument to moderation

* False equivalence.

* Proof by assertion - Politicians
* Proof by 
* Equivocation
* Shifting the burden of proof.




To correctly refute an argument, the falsehood of either the assumptions or
the reasoning must be shown to be incorrect.
