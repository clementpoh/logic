# Adducing addled arguments

History has decisively demonstrated human obstinacy. Often people favour and
recall information that only reinforce prior beliefs. The motivations are
many. Freud called it *rationalizing*. Camus condemned *ulterior motives*. When
faced with data that contradicts conceptions many would rather distort or
disregard reality than reconcile it.

Psychology has graciously bequeathed us with terms for these phenomena:
confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.

However, it could be naivety or none of the above.

It may very well be as the Victorian author George McDonald said:

> To give truth to him who loves it not is to only give him more multiplied
> reasons for misinterpretation.

Even just to list the iffy techniques humans have used to justify their
reasoning is challenging task.

However truth is independent of human.

Socrates succinctly stated ‘To use words wrongly and indefinitely is not merely
an error in itself, it also creates evil in the soul.’

## Equivocation

1. Light illuminates the dark.
1. An empty sack is light.
1. Therefore empty sacks illuminate the dark.

The following are common pitfalls people potentially posit when wielding faulty
reasoning.

* Dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating its absurdity.

* Arguments from ignorance.
  * I don't know statistics, but I know they can lie.
  * I can't believe it, so it must be false!

* Arguments from silence - Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

* Argument to moderation

* False equivalence.

* Proof by assertion - Politicians
* Proof by
* Equivocation
* Shifting the burden of proof.

To correctly refute an argument, the falsehood of either the assumptions or
the reasoning must be shown to be incorrect.
