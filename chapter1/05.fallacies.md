# Adducing addled arguments

The Wright brothers may have invented powered flight by having their heads in
the clouds, but their feet were firmly ground in reliable analysis. They
succeeded where countless others failed was by working with the law of gravity,
rather than proving the law while breaking themselves. Similarly good arguments
are made working with the laws of logic.

As we have seen, logical arguments made from incorrect assumptions lead to
incorrect conclusions.

To list the faulty techniques people have argued with would be to write the
history of humanity. Some are simpler to scrutinize once we start on symbolic
representations of logic. However, some common fallacies are covered here.

## Psychological fallacies

Psychologically people are susceptible to accepting assertions that may sound
plausible and are repeated often. If no reasoning is forthcoming, it's called a
**proof by assertion** or **argument from repetition**.

On the other hand, dismissing an argument as absurd without demonstrating how
it is absurd is called an **appeal to the stone**.

A person may instead attack the proponent of the offending claim, in an attempt
at a character assassination. However **ad-hominem** attacks may cast doubt on
a person's character, do not disprove the claim.

Often people favour and recall information that only reinforce prior beliefs.
When faced with data that contradicts conceptions many would rather distort or
disregard reality than reconcile it.

A friend once had a lecturer who said *"I don't know statistics, but I know
they can lie."* This is a classic example of an **argument from ignorance**.
The lecturer does not agree with the conclusion but is too intellectually lazy
to try to disprove it.

If a naive student who took the class consequently used the lecturer's prestige
to refute the original claim, that would be an example of an **appeal to
authority**. The lecturer is of dubious authority, and there is no reasoning
provided.

There many motivations for flawed reasoning. Freud called it *rationalizing*.
Camus condemned *ulterior motives*. It could be naivety or none of the above.
Psychology has graciously bequeathed us with terms for these phenomena:
confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.

However, to assume a person's beliefs are incorrect by their motives is also
defective reasoning. This is called a **genetic fallacy**. The provenance of a
belief may shed light on an issue. The problem is that the argument is not
assessed on its merits.

Apparently August Kekule apparently discovered the ring shape of the Benzene
molecule after daydreaming about Ouroboros, a snake biting its own tail. The
shape of the molecule is independent of his inspiration.

Combined with a **circular argument**, the person committing the fallacy
assumes the argument is erroneous and seeks to explain it away.  An example of
this would be *"You say that because you're a man!"*.

* Argument to moderation
* False equivalence.

To correctly refute an argument, the falsehood of either the assumptions or the
reasoning must be shown to be incorrect.

## Linguistic fallacies

> To use words wrongly and indefinitely is not merely an error in itself, it
> also creates evil in the soul. - Socrates

1. Light illuminates the dark.
1. My bag is light.
1. Therefore my empty bag illuminates the dark.

Unfortunately I do not have a bag made of light. The issue here is linguistic,
*light* in $$(1)$$ has a different to *light* in $$(2)$$.

Due to its inherent ambiguity human natural language is an imperfect medium to
analyse arguments. Symbolic logic is so powerful because it allows logicians to
translate arguments into an abstract form to analyse the validity of the
argument depending on its form.
