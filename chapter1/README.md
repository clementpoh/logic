# The ubiquitous use of logic

Some statements on the surface sound sound. Upon further examination the
statements suddenly sound slightly strange after all. Sometimes certain
statements sound stupid. However, after sounding out the subtleties, the
statements are sound after all. Logic is a tool that can guide us through
the cacophony away from the noise.

I remember crashing a friend's introductory philosophy lecture in early 2009
just before I went to Japan for a year long exchange programme. The lecturer
was teaching basic logic. He said something like:

> All this stuff is useless except that you can now say cool words like
> "disjunctive syllogism" and your friends won't understand you. In fact,
> philosophy is so useless that thanks to the incoming Melbourne Model I will
> be out of job at the end of the semester.

I was appalled. I remember thinking no wonder he is losing his job, logic is
used ubiquitously. On a practical level, logic is indispensable to the circuits
of calculators, computers and phones. On a philosophical level it can be
applied to validate arguments and assertions we encounter in everyday life.

Before exploring basic formalisations of logic, in this section we will very
briefly cover the history and context of logical reasoning and thought.
Properties of truth, and the limits of logic are discussed. We will then finish
with some common pitfalls and issues in its application.
