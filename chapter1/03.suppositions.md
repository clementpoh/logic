# Starting from sound suppositions

We have seen that assuming *everything is true*, or that *nothing is true* are
not useful presuppositions.

Logical systems start with *axioms*. Axioms are the premises and premises for
reasoning in a logical system. In current philosophy, there are many opinions
on what it means for a logical or mathematical statement to be true. However,
the ancients believed axioms to be self-evident; true without needing
explanation. Axioms are truth definitely known.

Not all assertions are accurate. The following are examples of interesting
claims that have been postulated. However, as we shall see consistency is
key.

## The problem with positivism

Positivism was posited in the early 20th century. It was a reductionist
movement that the only source of truth was sensory experience.

They held to the vaunted verification principle. An early formulation was
apparently:
> Only that which can be tested by the five senses could be verified as true.

However the statement cannot be tested by the five senses.

Logical positivism was an intellectual successor to positivism and Bertrand
Russel's Logicism. Logicism sought to reduce physical science to mathematics,
and mathematics to logic. Thanks to Kurt Godel's incompleteness theorems it has
been shown this is impossible.

Their formulation of verificationism was apparently:

> Only statements that are empirically verifiable or mathematically provable
> are meaningful.

However the formulation itself is not empirically verifiable nor mathematically
provable.

A.J Ayer a great proponent of the movement is later to have been quoted saying:

>  Any iconoclast who brandishes a debunker's sword should be required to
>  demonstrate it publicly on his own beliefs.

## Refuting relativism

A mood that I find is fairly popular now is relativism. Most will have
encountered formulations of this. I will discuss here what can be called
metaphysical relativism and epistemological relativism. Metaphysical relativism
basically that there are no absolutes in reality. Epistemological relativism
states that it's impossible to know anything.

Some basic formulations are:
> * Everything is relative.
> * All truth is relative.
> * There are no absolute truths.
> * What's true for you is not true for me.

All the statements are absolute statements. If they're true, then not
everything is relative so the statements are false.

> It's impossible to know anything.

If that's true, then it's impossible to know whether the statement is true. So
it is a fact that "*It's impossible to know anything*" is itself impossible to
know. This is an admission that at least one fact is knowable. It is therefore
self-refuting.

A serious relativist may claim that some statements are indeed outside the
scope of relativism. If it is claimed that logic can't be applied to a system
of thought, under what criteria is a system exempt from logic? Arbitrarily
exempting a system from logic is often a tacit admission of its inherent
logical problems.

On the other hand the relativist may claim that in fact relativism is only
relatively true to their own conceptual framework. By the relativist's own
standards, an absolutist is then perfectly entitled to reject relativism.

Lip-service may be paid to logic but people are often satisfied with their
suppositions. Introducing content counter to their conceptions for curiosity
may be comparatively contentious. However the choice of axioms, or a priori
assumptions that inform our views are important as they lead to different
conclusions. Self-refuting claims make for poor axioms.
