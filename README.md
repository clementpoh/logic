Introduction
============

A series of posts on introductory logic, and its applications to everyday life.

Formal methods to translate arguments into logic and validate their claims.

Scope
-----

I have wanted to write down what I learned about logic and its related
applications for a while. What I know best is what I have taught the most.

I will also include other content outside of the scope of what was taught in
University.

Much of the material here will have been borrowed heavily from my experience
teaching. It will cover some of the same ground as the subjects I helped teach
at Melbourne University. Specifically:
* Logic and Computation;
* Discrete Structures; and
* Models of Computation.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Content borrowed from coursework would be most indebted to Harald Sondergaard
and Peter Schacte.

For claims outside the scope of these subjects, there are various books and
articles I read, titles and authors of which are lost in the haze of my memory.
However while compiling these notes it's likely Wikipedia and Google were
consulted for quick verification.

Disclaimer
----------

* Please treat this as tongue in cheek rather than triumphant treatise. 

* If I do grossly misrepresent a position, let me know.

* It might seem a strange subject to subject anyone to. If you find my babbling
  baffling or the discussion disgusting, just discontinue.

* I do a quick check of the claims I make against Wikipedia and google, but I
  won't put too much verve into verifying the veracity of my historical claims.

* This is written purely out of interest. It does not adhere to rigorous
  academic standards.
