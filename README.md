Introduction

A series of posts on introductory logic, and its application to everyday life.

Some statements on the surface sound sound. Upon further examination the statements suddenly sound slightly strange after all. Sometimes certain statements sound stupid. However, after sounding out the subtleties, the statements are sound after all. Logic is a tool that can guide us through the noise.

It might be a strange subject to subject anyone to. If you find my babbling baffling or the discussion disgusting, just discontinue.

However first a disclaimer: I won't put much verve into verifying the veracity of my historical claims.
