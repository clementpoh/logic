Recently Iâ€™ve noticed how things are said that on the surface sound sound. Upon further examination the statements suddenly sound slightly strange after all. On the other hand, sometimes some statements sound stupid, but after sounding out the subtleties, the statements are sound after all. Logic is a tool that can guide us through the noise.

I would to talk about a topic that's close to my heart: logic. It might be a strange subject to subject anyone to. If you find my babbling baffling or the discussion disgusting, just discontinue.

However, first a disclaimer: I may be waxing about logic lyrically, but I won't put much verve into verifying the veracity of my historical claims.
