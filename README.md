Introduction
============

A series of posts on introductory logic, and its applications to everyday life.

Formal methods to translate arguments into logic and validate their claims.

* Please treat this as tongue in cheek rather than triumphant treatise. 

* If I do grossly misrepresent a position, let me know.

* It might seem a strange subject to subject anyone to. If you find my babbling
  baffling or the discussion disgusting, just discontinue.

* I won't put much verve into verifying the veracity of my historical claims.

* This is written purely out of interest. It does not adhere to rigorous
  academic standards. It should be considered more like a lecture reader.

Much of the material here will have been borrowed heavily from my experience
teaching. It will cover much of the same ground as the subjects I helped teach
at Melbourne University. Specifically:
* Logic and Computation;
* Discrete Structures; and
* Models of Computation.

Other material from different but related subjects may also be borrowed.
Specifically:
* Declarative Programming;
* Design of Algorithms; and
* Programming Language Implementation.

Therefore this would be most indebted to Harald Sondergaard and Peter Schacte.
For claims outside the scope of these subjects, Wikipedia and Google are
consulted.
