The ubiquitous use of logic
=======

Recently I’ve noticed how many things are said that on the surface sound sound, but upon further examination the statements suddenly sound slightly strange afterall. On the other hand, sometimes some statements sound stupid, but after sounding out the subtleties, the statements are sound afterall. Logic is a tool that can guide us through the noise.

I would to talk about a topic that’s close to my heart: logic. It might be a strange subject to subject anyone to, but if you find my babbling baffling or the discussion disgusting, just discontinue. However, first a disclaimer: I may be waxing about logic lyrically, but I won’t put much verve into verifying the veracity of my historical claims.

Humans have been drawing lines in the sand since the dawn of time. looking at those lines lead people to geometry; famously Pythagoras reasoned about lines, angles and triangles around 500 BC. However apocryphally he was rather irrational, his followers threw a man into the sea to keep secret that √2 isn’t rational. Yet somehow, they call the numbers rather than the people irrational.

Socrates, Plato and the sophists were apparently arguing around 400 BC, but it was Aristotle rooted in rationalism who really made reasonable progress on reason in response to his forebears. He started the systematisation of logical laws like modus ponens, a form of deductive reasoning. An example of the modus ponens:

If Clement was born in Singapore, then he is Singaporean.
Clement was born in Singapore.
Therefore, Clement is Singaporean.

Tools are vital for any craft. Where geometry could be done through drawing and measurement, the tools for abstract reasoning were less obvious. It’s easy to imagine calculating the root of two is rough with roman numerals. In the meantime philosophy, logic and theology were intertwined and progress proceeded prosaically as the tools for thought slowly developed and percolated throughout the intellectual world.

Leibniz made symbolic progress around the mid 17th century. He was a great mathematician, discovering calculus independently of Newton. Others would later lambaste Leibniz for plagiarising Newton who is credited as the conventional creator of calculus; however it’s Leibniz rather than Newtonian notation now in common use. Leibniz’s leap was his understanding that representation is relevant to human thought, and the idea that much reasoning could be reduced to mathematical calculation.

Around 2000 years after Aristotle, George Boole burst onto the scene. Before Boole logicians were mostly reasoning in rhetoric. Now this may not seem obvious, but Boole proposed a system with more pros than prose, symbolic logic. Rigorous mathematical logic was one of George Boole’s great achievements, he liberated logic from language by the fomenting its formalisation. Boole’s eponymous Boolean algebra retired imprecise rambling and relinquished rhetoric’s hold on reason.

I remember crashing a friend’s introductory philosophy lecture in early 2009 just before I went to Japan. The lecturer was going through basic logic. He said something like: 

All this stuff is  useless except that you can now say cool words like ‘disjunctive syllogism’ and your friends can’t understand you. In fact, philosophy is so useless that thanks to the incoming Melbourne Model I will be out of job at the end of the semester.

I was appalled. I remember thinking no wonder he is losing his job, logic is applied ubiquitously. In logical circuits. The least the lecturer could have done is taught symbolic logic.
