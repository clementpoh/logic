Introduction
============

A series of posts on introductory logic, and its applications to everyday life.

Motivation
----------

I remember crashing a friend's introductory philosophy lecture in early 2009
just before I went to Japan. The lecturer was teaching basic logic. He
said something like:

> All this stuff is  useless except that you can now say cool words like
> "disjunctive syllogism" and your friends can't understand you. In fact,
> philosophy is so useless that thanks to the incoming Melbourne Model I will
> be out of job at the end of the semester.

I was appalled. I remember thinking no wonder he is losing his job, logic is
used ubiquitously. In logical circuits to begin with, and can be applied
to everyday life.

Some statements on the surface sound sound. Upon further examination the
statements suddenly sound slightly strange after all. Sometimes certain
statements sound stupid. However, after sounding out the subtleties, the
statements are sound after all. Logic is a tool that can guide us through
the cacophony away from the noise.

* It might seem a strange subject to subject anyone to. If you find my babbling
baffling or the discussion disgusting, just discontinue.

* I won't put much verve into verifying the veracity of my historical claims.

* This is written purely out of interest. It does not adhere to rigorous academic standards. It should be considered more like a lecture reader. I am not bothering to reference properly.

Much of the material here will have been borrowed heavily from my experience teaching. It will cover much of the same ground as the subjects I helped teach at Melbourne University. Specifically:
* Logic and Computation;
* Discrete Structures; and
* Models of Computation.

Other material from different but related subjects may also be borrowed. Specifically:
 * Declarative Programming;
 * Design of Algorithms; and
 * Programming Language Implementation.

Therefore this would be most indebted to Harald Sondergaard and Peter Schacte.
