Recently I’ve noticed how many things are said that on the surface sound sound, but upon further examination the statements suddenly sound slightly strange afterall. On the other hand, sometimes some statements sound stupid, but after sounding out the subtleties, the statements are sound afterall. Logic is a tool that can guide us through the noise.

I would to talk about a topic that’s close to my heart: logic. It might be a strange subject to subject anyone to, but if you find my babbling baffling or the discussion disgusting, just discontinue. However, first a disclaimer: I may be waxing about logic lyrically, but I won’t put much verve into verifying the veracity of my historical claims.
